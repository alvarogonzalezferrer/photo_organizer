# Photo Organizer

Photo organizer for your local photo backups. 

Move photos to month and day folders according to their EXIF data.

Automatically find the original date taken of their photos and then move and sort the photos into folders based on that date.

When you download your photos to your computer the file date is not necessarily the same as the date you took the photo. 

If you have a large number of files on your memory card or hard drive with photos taken over many different days it can be a mess to try to organize the photos.
